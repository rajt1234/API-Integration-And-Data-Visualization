# 🔌 API Integration And Data Visualization
Created a fully working 'Weather Report Dashboard' by integrating 'OpenWeatherMap_API'. Through this dashboard you can easily see weather report of a city/location, this 
includes different visualizations for better understanding the weather report and analyse different parameters.
# 📚 Source
I have built a weather report dashboard using :-
##### • OpenWeatherMap_API which is a free weather API source. With the help of this API I easily get the weather data for making this project.
##### • And I also used 'Streamlit Module' to design a frontend for my weather dashboard. It provided layout options to organize components like plots, maps, buttons, and tables.
##### • Dashboard also include 'OpenStreetMap', which I used to display geographic data.
##### • I also used different libraries for plotting the data, they are mentioned in the code.
# ❓How to run the code ?
## 🔧 To run the code:-
#### • Copy the code.
#### • Then in terminal give command 'streamlit run weather_dashboard.py', It will open the Dashboard on web.
NOTE - I have used "Visual Studio Code" to make and run my code.
